            <p>
                At his home in Mount Vernon, George Washington operated the nation's largest distillery.  It produced nearly 11,000 gallons a year and is still in production today.

        <h2 class="content-head is-center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="pure-g">
    
            <div class="l-box-lrg pure-u-1">
                <h4>What is distilling?</h4>
                <p>
                    Distilling is the boiling, cooling, and collecting of alcohol out of an already alcoholic liquid.  Alcohol has a lower boiling point than water, so it evaporates first.  The steam can then be condensed and collected as a liquid.
                </p>
                <h4>Isn't distilling dangerous?</h4>
                <p>
                    With the proper safety precautions, distilling isn't terribly dangerous.  Most of the dangers of distilling come from improper equipment and poor ventilation.  If you think that sounds like bootleggers hiding a home-made still in a basement or shed, you're probably right.  Reforming the laws to allow distilling out in the open on professionally made equipment will reduce these dangers even more.
                </p>

                <h4>But what about poisoning? Rotgut? Blindness?</h4>
                <p>
                    It's true, methanol is poisonous, but it's not as big of a problem as you may think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Distilling isn't creating alcohol, it's just isolating it from the water around it.  Methanol, sometimes called "wood alcohol" &ndash; the toxic stuff, isn't really produced in most furit and grain fermentation.  If it's not in the mash you're distilling, it's not going to be in the distilled spirit.  Even when it is present, methanol has a different boiling point from ethanol and is easy to separate out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the poisoning you've probably heard about isn't actually methanol poisoning.  It's heavy metals like lead seeping into the spirits because the distillers used old car parts to build their still.  Glass or copper stills do not experience this problem.
                </p>

                <h4>But isn't this about public safety?</h4>
                <p>
                    26 U.S. Code § 5178 does regulate the building of a distillation plant the following way: 
                </p>
                <blockquote>(a)(1)(a) <br>
                    The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations relating to the location, construction, arrangement, and protection of distilled spirits plants as he deems necessary to facilitate inspection and afford adequate security to the revenue.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    It is a bit curious that the last word is revenue and not safety.  But it goes on:
                </p>
                <blockquote>(2)(C) The Secretary is authorized to order and require—<br>
                    (ii) such fastenings, locks, and seals to be part of any of the stills, tubs, pipes, tanks, and other equipment, as he may deem necessary to facilitate inspection and afford adequate security to the revenue.
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Is this just about not paying taxes?</h4>
                <p>
                    No.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Prohibition, beer- and wine-making at home effectively became illegal, and remained illegal until the passage of H.R. 1337 in 1978, which authorized tax-free production of 100 gallons per person per year.  Right now, our country is in a beer and wine <i>renaissance</i> &ndash; more beers, wines, and bitters are on the market than ever before.  This is largely in part to the legalization of home-production for experimenting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Distilled spirits are not growing at the same rate because becoming a distiller is somewhat of a catch-22; you're not allowed to distill spirits unless you have a permit, but getting a permit is so expensive that nobody would apply unless they already know how to distill.  By legalizing distilling of spirits for personal and family use, we can expect a similar renaissance of distilleries opening and more creative liquors coming to market.
